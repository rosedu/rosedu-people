These guidelines are here to help people collaborate, learn and contribute to a great Open Source Software project!

## Submitting a bug
If you submit a bug please add a screenshot or description of the __effect__. Github knows to upload pictures from clipboard :).
If you know the steps of __reproducing__ the bug please share them.

## Creating an issue

An issue must be specified so __everyone__ who reads it and knows how People looks like, knows __what__ must be done and __why__.

We want the issues to be specified this way in order to make any developer, new or with experience, understand the __problem__ and implement it as good as he can.

A good starting template is this one. You can copy/paste it from [here](https://raw.github.com/rosedu/rosedu-people/master/doc/issue_template.md).

#### Need

``` gherkin
In order to <the benefit of the issue being solved>
As a <stakeholder e.g. developer, user, company, comunity member, etc.>
I want to <the feature/enhancement that needs to be implemented in the issue>
```

#### Deliverables
_a list of high end benefits that will be delivered when the issue is completed._

_examples:_
- World Peace and harmony
- An ending to World Hunger
 

#### Prerequisites
_If you already know parts of the code or documents that could help a developer get to the deliverables share them here._
_You can add documents, blogposts, links to code._

- [Mihai B on world peace](http://mihaibivol.worldpeace.org)
- [Current implementation of WorldPeace class](http://somelinktoafile)

#### Solution
_If you know the basic steps of implementing it, share with others!_

## Working on an issue

You already have an issue that follows the format mentioned above and you want to start coding.

To help __others__ understand how you approached the problem please update the issue with a small description of the solution.
If you encounter problems, please share them in the comments.

#### Git, hub and magic
In order to have the code linked with the issue it solves the following flow is preffered.

##### You don't have access to this repo.
- Fork this project and add the upstream remote. Detailed instructions are found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

#### Basic steps
- Create a branch named {{issue_number}}-small-description-of-issue
```
$ git checkout -b 42-end-to-world-hunger
```

- Start working on the issue.
- Use commits that make only one change. Include the issue number in the commit.
```
$ git commit -m "Give food to random strangers #42"
```

- Push to a remote branch named as the local one. Please use the __explicit__ push command.
```
$ git push origin 42-end-to-world-hunger
```

- You think you are done. Run the tests suite
```
./manage.py test
```

- If nothing fails, create a pull request on the issue you are trying to solve. Please use [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) to do that.
You will see that the issue will be transformed in a pull-request containing the issue description shown above.
```
$ hub pull-request -i 42 -b rosedu:rosedu-people -h $GITHUB_USER:42-end-to-wolrd-hunger #If you have access to the repo $GITHUB_USER is rosedu
```

- Ask for a code review using @reviewer_name tags in comments
- If the pull request can't be merged please merge the master branch into your branch.
```bash
# if working on a fork
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
# if working on the rosedu repo
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/master
```
- Congratulations! You have made a contribution to this project!
